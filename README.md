# Meme generator (part from learning React)
Mini project followed on the course "Learn React JS" by freeCodeCamp.org to generate a random meme with top and bottom text.

Instead of following the traditional class-based components on React, as shown by the video, I've converted mines to actually use hooks on functional components.

The complete course was followed here:
